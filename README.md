# epialleJS
Direscription:
A software used for identifying unique epiallele of a sample or common epiallele of two samples through RRBS or WGBS file with sam format and calculating Jensen-Shannon divergence of the epialle of two samples. 

Requirements:
1) Perl with version >=5.0 is required before using epialleJS;
2) The perl module of Getopt::Long should be installed;
3) Linux operating system is prefered;
4) Input file should be the sam file of RRBS or WGBS;

Usage:

1） Appending environment variables of epialleJS to the line "export path=$path:" of the ~/.bash_profile in the user personal directory or switching to the path to epialleJS before runing the software;

2） After switching to the path to epialleJS, command for identifying unique epiallele of a sample is:./unialle -a file1 -o outputpath -c coverage -d distance

command for identifying common epiallele of two samples is:./epialle -a file1 -b file2 -o outputpath -c coverage -d distance

Parameter specification:
-a or -b: file of sam format used for identifying epiallele;
-o: output file pathway;
-c: the coverage used for identifying epiallele;
-d: distance used to control the length of epiallele.

Example: 
recognization of unique epiallele from test.sam file 
cd /path/to/epialle/ 
./unialle -a ./test.sam -o ./ 
the recognized unique epialle result file was stored in "test_epialle.txt" file
